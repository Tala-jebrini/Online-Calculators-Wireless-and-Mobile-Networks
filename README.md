# üì° Online Calculators for Wireless and Mobile Networks

This project is a Flask-based web application providing a set of **interactive engineering calculators** for key topics in **Wireless and Mobile Networks**. It is designed to help students and engineers compute values related to digital communication, LTE systems, transmission power, throughput analysis, and cellular network planning.

## üåê Live Features

The application includes the following calculators:

1. **Digital Communication Calculator**  
   - Calculates sampling frequency, quantization levels, and bit rates across source/channel encoding and interleaving.

2. **LTE System Calculator**  
   - Determines the number of bits per OFDM symbol and estimates maximum data transmission rate.

3. **Transmit Power Calculator**  
   - Computes required transmit power (in dB, dBm, and Watts) using path loss, gains, and noise considerations.

4. **Throughput Calculator**  
   - Estimates channel throughput using various MAC protocols including ALOHA and CSMA variants.

5. **Cellular System Calculator**  
   - Performs radio planning: cell size, cluster size, Erlang-B, number of carriers, and coverage distance.
